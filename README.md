# Dice Duel

**Dice Duel** is a fun and interactive two-player game where each player takes turns rolling a dice to accumulate points,aiming to reach or exceed a score of 50 to win. 
Players must decide whether to roll the dice or hold their score, but rolling a 1 resets their current turn's points.


## Gameplay

1. Each player takes turns rolling a dice.
2. If the player rolls any number other than 1, it is added to their current score.
3. The player can choose to "Hold", adding their current score to their total score.
4. If the player rolls a 1, their current score for that turn is reset, and it becomes the next player's turn.
5. The first player to reach or exceed 50 points wins the game.
